# Miscellaneous-Personal-Projects

This is a compilation of some of my favorite projects I have worked on in my personal time.
These are unrefined and more a demonstration of my learning.
I made most of these before I learned some of the better industry practices, such as Commenting, Naming Convention, and how to reduce repetitiveness.

My home for this Repo, is to prove I have experience learning, writing, developing, and refining code, not as a demonstration of ability.
I will/have better examples of refined work linked elsewhere.
